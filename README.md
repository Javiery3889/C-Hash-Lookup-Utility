# Task 1 (Hash lookup generator)
* This program takes in 3 parameters: wordlist filename, a integer representing the minimum length of the password and another integer representing the maximum length of the password.
* This program uses the crypt.h library and its functions to create a simple MD5 and SHA-512 hash from a password in the wordlist file (specified on the command line).
* Afterwards, the program writes the two respective hashes of the password into mytab2411.txt.
